# Text-Based-Browser
Project of JetBrains Academy on hyperskill.org


## About
Sometimes you need to read online documentation or find something on the Internet from the command line or terminal. So, let's use Python to create a text-based browser! Of course, making a real, full-blown browser is a very difficult task. In this project, you'll create a very simple browser that will ignore JavaScript and CSS, won't have cookies, and will only process a limited set of tags. Still, it will be useful and, most importantly, fun to program!

## Learning outcomes
You will learn how HTTP works and how to handle its protocols using Python. You will also learn all about Python input/output, as well as parsing HTML.
